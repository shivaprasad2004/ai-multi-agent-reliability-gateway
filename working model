 1. What is this application?

Name: AI Multi-Agent Reliability Microservice Gateway
It is a backend microservice + dashboard that sits between users and multiple AI models (like OpenAI, Gemini, etc.).
Instead of your app directly calling one AI model, it calls this gateway, and the gateway:

The AI Multi-Agent Reliability Microservice Gateway is a backend microservice + admin dashboard that sits between users and multiple AI models (OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, etc.).
Instead of your app calling a single AI model directly, it calls this gateway, which:

Runs the request through multiple AI agents
→ Generator → Safety → Quality
Selects the best provider/model
Applies retries, fallbacks, timeouts, and circuit breakers
Performs safety & quality validation
Uses caching to reduce cost and improve speed
Logs every request for metrics, monitoring, and debugging

In simple words:
It is a smart control center that guarantees safe, reliable, high-quality AI responses.

2. Why was it built? (Problem it solves)

Modern AI systems have real issues:
❗ Hallucinations — AI giving confidently wrong answers
❗ API failures — timeouts, rate limits, slow responses
❗ Provider inconsistency — each model gives different answers
❗ Unsafe output — PII leakage, toxic text, policy violations
❗ No reliability layer — companies cannot trust raw AI output

This project solves these problems by offering:
✔ Stable & predictable AI responses
✔ Automatic fallback if one model fails
✔ Higher-quality answers through multiple agents
✔ Safety checks & guardrails
✔ Complete visibility through logs & metrics
✔ Monitoring of latency, errors, cache hits, and provider performance

In one line:
It turns normal AI calls into reliable, safe, high-quality AI services.


3. Working Model – How the system actually works (step-by-step)
User / Client App
        │
        ▼
AI Gateway API  (POST /api/v1/ai/chat)
        │
        ▼
Input Guardrails  
  - validates prompt  
  - blocks unsafe input
        │
        ▼
Cache Check  
  ├── Hit → return stored result  
  └── Miss → proceed
        │
        ▼
Multi-Agent Pipeline
   1) Generator Agent → creates the answer
   2) Safety Agent → checks PII, toxicity, policy issues
   3) Quality Agent → improves clarity, grammar, formatting

Each agent call includes:
   - Reliability Layer (retry + timeout + fallback + circuit breaker)
   - Provider Adapter (OpenAI / Gemini / Mock)
        │
        ▼
Output Guardrails  
  - JSON validation  
  - Safety + PII check
        │
        ▼
Persist Data  
  - cache_entries (for reuse)  
  - requests (for metrics/logs)
        │
        ▼
Return Final Polished Response

The React dashboard displays:
Request logs
Real-time metrics (latency, errors, cache hits)
Provider/model/agent configuration
Guardrail violations
Playground UI to test prompts
      
4. Where can this be used? (Real-world applications)
This gateway is useful in any system where AI accuracy, safety, and reliability are critical, such as:
✔ Customer Support Bots
Consistent, safe replies even if one model fails.
✔ EdTech / Learning Platforms
Produce age-safe, correct explanations and summaries.
✔ Enterprise Internal Tools
Avoid leaks of confidential information.
✔ Code Assistants / Dev Tools
Use multi-agent flow for generation, review, and improvement.
✔ FinTech / Healthcare AI Interfaces
Where accuracy and traceability matter most.

In short: any product that cannot afford unreliable AI responses.
